This paper explores whether, by integrating language, by way of a semantic legal layer, into blockchain-based 
smart contracts, smart contracts could become full legal contracts. 
The current blockchain landscape, in and of itself, is insufficient to capture the nuance of contract language,
to preserve the evidence of the contracting process for those cases where parol evidence might be admissible, 
or to provide for the many non-financial terms that parties typically negotiate as part of a contract. However,
the integration of a semantic legal layer – utilizing jurisdiction specific legal ontologies – could add 
the precision, flexibility, and enforceability to blockchain-based smart contracts to allow them to serve 
the same purposes at their traditional progenitors. 


Integrating legal language into smart contracting processes, then, is no small feat. Particularly for contracts
between major enterprises, smart contracts are highly unlikely to eliminate the need for legal counsel with 
expertise in both the industry(ies) and jurisdiction(s) pertinent to the contract. A number of clauses, 
such as choice of law, indemnification, disclaimer of warranty, limit of liability, assignability,
termination, modification, and so forth, will still need to be negotiated between parties. For contracting parties 
without counsel at their disposal, however, fully legal smart contracts could potentially “level the playing field,” 
giving them at least some access, through an ontology, to the same language used so effectively by attorneys, 
in addition to access to automated enforcement.
