This paper, written by, Satoshi Nakamoto introduced blockchain technology to the world.

In this paper he had discussed a solution to the trust-based model of finanical systems and 
introduced an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party. These transactions are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. 

In this paper, he proposed a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The security 
in the system is guaranteed as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating
group of attacker nodes.

This paper hightlights the fact that different trustless parties can collaborate with each other 
without a central authority if all the parties are in a network agree on some consensus.
